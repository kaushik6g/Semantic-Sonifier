🔊 Semantic Sonifier

Semantic Sonifier is an innovative project that converts textual data into meaningful sound patterns using semantic analysis. The system interprets the context and semantics of input text and maps them to audio elements such as pitch, tone, rhythm, and intensity, enabling users to hear the meaning of data.

This project bridges Natural Language Processing (NLP) and audio signal processing, making abstract or large-scale textual information more intuitive and accessible. It can be especially useful for data exploration, accessibility applications, and creative data representation.
